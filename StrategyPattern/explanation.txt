defines a family of algorithms (grouping of algorithms that do or are related tothe same idea)
and encapsulates each one (wraps a class around the functionality)
and makes them interchangeable (likely uses an interface to swap out behaviors)

MAIN POINT!!!
lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it
